**Traffic-Sign-Classification_Project**

This is a Convolutional Neural Network built with TensorFlow and trained to recognize traffic signs. The dataset used is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.

**Training and Experimentation Results**

The final model achieves an accuracy of 97.9% on the official GTSRB test dataset.

The model includes my own implementation of batch normalization using a running average estimator of the population moments, along with a few tests and visualizations to see what batch normalization does.

All code, training results, and relevant explanations and comments are contained in the iPython notebook in this directory.
